# üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

## Overview
This document provides an in-depth look at the architectural design of our E-Commerce Application.

## High-Level Architecture

### Architectural Style
- Microservices Architecture
- Hexagonal (Ports and Adapters) Design Pattern
- Event-Driven Communication

### Components

#### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **UI Library**: Material-UI
- **Routing**: React Router
- **Hosting**: Vercel

#### Backend
- **Framework**: NestJS
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ

## Microservices Design

### User Service
- Responsible for user registration, authentication, and profile management
- Implements JWT-based authentication
- Handles user roles and permissions

### Product Service
- Manages product catalog
- Handles product CRUD operations
- Implements search and filtering capabilities

### Order Service
- Manages order creation, tracking, and processing
- Handles order state management
- Integrates with payment and inventory services

### Payment Service
- Manages payment transactions
- Supports multiple payment gateways
- Handles payment verification and reconciliation

### Notification Service
- Manages email and push notifications
- Handles event-driven communication
- Supports multiple notification channels

## Communication Patterns

### Inter-Service Communication
- REST APIs for synchronous communication
- RabbitMQ for asynchronous event-driven communication
- gRPC for high-performance service-to-service communication

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Publish/Subscribe model
- Event sourcing for critical business processes
- Eventual consistency

## Data Management

### Database Strategy
- PostgreSQL as primary database
- Read replicas for scalability
- Sharding for horizontal scaling
- Prisma ORM for type-safe database interactions

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for distributed caching
- Multi-level caching (application and database levels)
- Cache invalidation mechanisms

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth 2.0 integration
- Multi-factor authentication support

### Network Security
- HTTPS everywhere
- API rate limiting
- Input validation
- Protection against OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities

## Scalability and Performance

### Horizontal Scaling
- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Auto-scaling based on load

### Performance Optimization
- Code splitting
- Lazy loading
- Server-side rendering
- Database query optimization
- CDN distribution

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Contextual logging
- Performance tracing

### Monitoring
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Sentry for error tracking
- Custom health check endpoints

## Deployment Strategy

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline
- Automated testing
- Automatic deployment to staging and production
- Feature flag management

### Infrastructure
- AWS ECS for container orchestration
- S3 for static asset storage
- CloudFront for content delivery
- Route 53 for DNS management

## Future Roadmap

- Implement GraphQL API
- Serverless architecture for specific services
- Machine learning-based recommendation system
- Advanced analytics and reporting
